# Corporate Catering Management System – The Gabba

## Overview

Working in the corporate section at **The Gabba** involves ensuring all food is delivered to the correct boxes at the correct times, while managing time changes, dietary requirements, late arrivals, and last-minute orders. Traditionally, this process relied on manually highlighting paper lists, handwriting times, and tracking changes by memory—making it slow and prone to errors.

This web-based program was developed to streamline that workflow, improve accuracy, and reduce manual overhead. As a result, food delivery records are significantly more reliable, service is faster, and staff can spend more time assisting with preparation rather than administration.

## Key Features

### 1. Excel-Based Input
- Upload an Excel spreadsheet containing:
  - Box locations  
  - Food items  
  - Scheduled food times  
- The system automatically parses and organises this data.

---

### 2. Attendance Page (Box Arrival Confirmation)
- Boxes must arrive before food preparation can begin to avoid food sitting out unattended.
- Box stewards confirm:
  - That the box has arrived  
  - That they are happy with the current food times  
  - Any dietary requirements  
- Food times and dietaries can be edited at this stage.

Once a box is confirmed, its food orders move to the **Order Section**.
